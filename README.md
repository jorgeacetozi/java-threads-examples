# Java Thread Simple Examples

This repository contains more than 20 simple examples with explanations on how to use Java Thread API and Executors Framework. Currently, the following subjects are covered:

- Running tasks from Thread and Runnable
- Strategies for returning values from Threads and Runnable tasks
- wait(), notify(), interrupt(), join(), isAlive()...
- Creating Thread Pools (FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, SingleThreadPool, ScheduledThreadPool...)
- Submiting tasks to ExecutorService
- Returning values from tasks using Callable<V> and Future<V>
- Naming threads and creating deamon threads in a thread pool implementing ThreadFactory interface
- Terminating tasks using Thread API
- Terminating tasks using Future<V>
- Handling exceptions in normal threads implementing UncaughtExceptionHandler interface
- Handling exceptions in threads on a thread pool implementing UncaughtExceptionHandler interface
- Managing tasks termination using CountDownLatch
- Running scheduled tasks using Timer and TimerTask
- Running scheduled tasks using ScheduledThreadPool

Of course there are much more than this to cover (such as Fork/Join Framework). Feel free to fork this project and contribute with more simple thread examples!
